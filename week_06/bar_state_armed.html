        <h1>People Shot by Police by State and Armed</h1>
        <p>This bar chart uses data from the Washington Post on people who were shot and killed by policy officers in 2015. 
            It illustrates the states where the shootings occured, and whether the person shot was armed.
            I initially used a donut plot to illustrate a geographic breakdown of where police shootings occurred. 
            However, this was not effective as the labels overlapped greatly since there are many states. 
            For this bar plot, it would be useful to scale the data by the state population to illustrate which states are
            disproportionately affected by police brutality. It might also be interesting to incorporate information on gun control laws.
