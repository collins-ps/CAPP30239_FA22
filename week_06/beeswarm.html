        <h1>People Shot by Police by Age</h1>
        <p>This beeswarm chart uses data from the Washington Post on people who were shot and killed by policy officers in 2015. 
            It illustrates the age distribution of people shot by the police. What is most striking about this plot 
            are the anomalous data points: those who were very young, and those who were very old. 
            Supplementary information to filter the plot by demographic factors such as race and gender could add further insights.
