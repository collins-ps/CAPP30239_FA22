        <h1>Police Shootings in 2015</h1>
        <p>I created three charts: a stacked bar chart of people shot by race and by gender, a beeswam plot of their ages, and a stacked bar chart by state and whether or not person was armed.</p>
        <p>
        The first bar illustrates the two demographic factors that are most skewed when it comes to police shootings: race and gender. 
        The limitation of this graph is that it is not scaled to the demographic breakdown in the population, 
        so it does not clearly illustrate how police shootings disproportionately affect males from minority races. 
        Incorporating supplementary demographic information on the population would improve the graph significantly. 
         </p>
         <p>
        The second beeswarm chart illustrates the age distribution of people shot by the police. What is most striking about this plot 
        are the anomalous data points: those who were very young, and those who were very old. 
        Supplementary information to filter the plot by demographic factors such as race and gender could add further insights.

        Data for all charts were taken from the Washington Post.
