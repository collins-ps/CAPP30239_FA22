I am a second-year CAPP student who is passionate about the intersection of computer science and public policy. Originally from Singapore, I moved to the US to attend college at UCLA where I majored in Global Studies. After college, I deferred graduate studies for a year to work at the Singapore National Trades Union Congress amidst the challenging labor environment during the Covid-19 pandemic. After graduation, I will return home to work as a civil servant in the Singapore Government.
