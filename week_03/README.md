## Description of data
The data was colleted by the National Environment Agency under the Government of Singapore on a monthly basis on various aspects of the environment. It provides a long time horizon of data from 1982 and 2022. The data is contained in .csv files, each containing a column for the month/year and a column for the data point.
## Why you are interested in this topic
I'm interested in climate change, and specifically how Singapore's climate has changed over the last four decades. As an island nation, Singapore is at risk from rising sea levels, however there could be much stronger support for policies to tackle climate change and for greater individual responsibility. 
## Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data
Visualizing the changes might motivate people to take climate change more seriously and to support bold policies to address it. However, I want to portray the information in a more engaging and compelling way that typical representations of climate change which I feel have not been very effective in conveying the urgency of the problem and motivating people to action.
## Potential data points
Potential data points include data on surface air temperature (mean, max, and min), humidity levels, amount of rainfall, and sunshine duration.
## Any concerns about the data
I am concerned that there not be clear patterns in the data based on the visualization that is prepared on the landing page for the datasets; but I also think this underscores the need to do a better visualization as the climate in Singapore has definitely changed due to global warning and the visualizations should reflect this reality.
## Identify if source is primary or secondary
Data is a primary source.
